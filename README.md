==========

The Big Bank is a small school project at University College of Northern Jutland (UCN) in Denmark at lecture Software Testing in class Business Batchelor in Software Development.

Basically it's to test automated testing (unit tests) everytime you do a commit to GIT with Jenkins and Travis.

### So please note
This project isn't really to much use, unless you are a part of the group.
